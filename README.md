Restaraunt Menu

This project is one of the ones I am most proud of from my time at Awesome Inc's bootcamp. I learned a lot about how to leverage Bootstrap's documentation and prebuilt components. I furthered my understanding of React and implemented a few key features that show what I was capable of at that time. I also utilized Axios to fetch data from an API we were provided with in order to display information about the menu items available on my Restaraunt menu.

Please take a look and let me know if you have any advice/questions!
